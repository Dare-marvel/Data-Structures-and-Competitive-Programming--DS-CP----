## Explanation
Below are the steps to implement the above idea:

* Scan the infix expression from left to right. 
* If the scanned character is an operand, put it in the postfix expression. 
* Otherwise, do the following
	* If the precedence and associativity of the scanned operator are greater than the precedence and associativity of the operator in the stack [or the stack is empty or the stack contains a ‘(‘ ], then push it in the stack. [‘^‘ operator is right associative and other operators like ‘+‘,’–‘,’*‘ and ‘/‘ are left-associative].
		* Check especially for a condition when the operator at the top of the stack and the scanned operator both are ‘^‘. In this condition, the precedence of the scanned operator is higher due to its right associativity. So it will be pushed into the operator stack. 
		* In all the other cases when the top of the operator stack is the same as the scanned operator, then pop the operator from the stack because of left associativity due to which the scanned operator has less precedence. 
	* Else, Pop all the operators from the stack which are greater than or equal to in precedence than that of the scanned operator.
		* After doing that Push the scanned operator to the stack. (If you encounter parenthesis while popping then stop there and push the scanned operator in the stack.) 
		* If the scanned character is a ‘(‘, push it to the stack. 
		* If the scanned character is a ‘)’, pop the stack and output it until a ‘(‘ is encountered, and discard both the parenthesis. 
		* Repeat steps 2-5 until the infix expression is scanned. 
		* Once the scanning is over, Pop the stack and add the operators in the postfix expression until it is not empty.
		* Finally, print the postfix expression.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
O(N), where N is the size of the infix expression

### `Space Complexity`:
O(N), where N is the size of the infix expression

## Code:
```java
// Java code to convert infix expression to postfix

import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.Stack;

class Test {

	// A utility function to return
	// precedence of a given operator
	// Higher returned value means
	// higher precedence
	static int Prec(char ch)
	{
		switch (ch) {
		case '+':
		case '-':
			return 1;

		case '*':
		case '/':
			return 2;

		case '^':
			return 3;
		}
		return -1;
	}

	// The main method that converts
	// given infix expression
	// to postfix expression.
	static String infixToPostfix(String exp)
	{
		// Initializing empty String for result
		String result = new String("");

		// Initializing empty stack
		Deque<Character> stack
			= new ArrayDeque<Character>();

		for (int i = 0; i < exp.length(); ++i) {
			char c = exp.charAt(i);

			// If the scanned character is an
			// operand, add it to output.
			if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(c))
				result += c;

			// If the scanned character is an '(',
			// push it to the stack.
			else if (c == '(')
				stack.push(c);

			// If the scanned character is an ')',
			// pop and output from the stack
			// until an '(' is encountered.
			else if (c == ')') {
				while (!stack.isEmpty()
					&& stack.peek() != '(') {
					result += stack.peek();
					stack.pop();
				}

				stack.pop();
			}
			
			// An operator is encountered
			else
			{
				while (!stack.isEmpty()
					&& Prec(c) <= Prec(stack.peek())) {

					result += stack.peek();
					stack.pop();
				}
				stack.push(c);
			}
		}

		// Pop all the operators from the stack
		while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
			if (stack.peek() == '(')
				return "Invalid Expression";
			result += stack.peek();
			stack.pop();
		}
		
		return result;
	}

	// Driver code
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		String exp = "a+b*(c^d-e)^(f+g*h)-i";
		
		// Function call
		System.out.println(infixToPostfix(exp));
	}
}
